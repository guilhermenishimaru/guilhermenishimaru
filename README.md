Hi, IÂ´m Guilherme Nishimaru. As a student of Production Engineering at UNESP in Bauru, I found myself deeply
interested in the area of technology related to data analysis after starting my work as
an intern, mainly because I understood how this specialty enables numerous
alternatives for improvement in terms of the efficiency of any processes. Today, I've got
a taste for programming and an immense interest in acquiring knowledge about tools
and languages related to the subject.
Since the company where I work is only partially focused on technology, I realized the
need to seek new opportunities for my development in the area through a more
favourable structure. That's why I'm applying for the job.
My responsibilities today involve creating Dashboards in Power BI based on the
database connected to the ERP system and through the SQL language in Grafana,
which handles the information from the database connected to the Workflow
management system.
I took an intensive English course in Vancouver to complete the advanced level of
proficiency in the language, during this and several other passages abroad, I was able
to significantly improve my conversation. I speak naturally, and that's why I
believe that these international experiences can be helpful, in the same
way, I am organized and curious, I have an analytical profile, and consequently, I am extremely
motivated by learning opportunities within the work.
Finally, my work ethic involves working together in a group so that synergy is always
effective so that all efforts are used in the best possible way through assertive
communication, thus contributing positively to achieving goals.
